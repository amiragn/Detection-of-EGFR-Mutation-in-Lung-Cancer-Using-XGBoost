# Detection-of-EGFR-Mutation-in-Lung-Cancer-Using-XGBoost
Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in Indonesia. Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene play a crucial role in determining treatment strategies. However, detection is often constrained by technologies like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and high costs. This study aims to develop a model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for a more efficient and affordable EGFR mutation detection. The dataset was obtained from the medical records of lung cancer patients at Dr. Saiful Anwar Hospital, Malang (2018â€“2019), which included mutation test results and cancer morphology. Data preprocessing involved KNN Imputer for handling missing values, IQR for outlier detection, feature selection using XGBoost feature importance, and resampling with SMOTE. The model was optimized using grid search, yielding the following best hyperparameters: gamma = 0, learning rate = 0.3, max depth = 3, n estimators = 50, and reg lambda = 1. Results showed an average accuracy of 0.844 and an AUC of 0.945 in validation, along with perfect accuracy and AUC of 1 on test data. The model highlighted 10 significant features, including bone metastasis, cancer stage, and others. The optimized XGBoost model is expected to facilitate early detection and improve the accessibility of lung cancer treatment in Indonesia.
